Many of my dotfiles are tied to a centralized themefile using [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/tree/master/templates][templates]]. The default theme values are [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/tree/master/wm/.wm/scripts/theming/defaults][here]], the theme files can be seen [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/tree/master/wm/.wm/themes][here]], and the [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/.wm/scripts/theming/ltheme][ltheme]] script ties it all together. Note: over time, the ltheme script has come to represent other dynamic parts of my setup as well, beyond just themes - this includes some user level systemd services.
