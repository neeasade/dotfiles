Many of my dotfiles are tied to a centralized theme file using [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/tree/master/templates][templates]]. The default theme values are [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/tree/master/wm/.wm/scripts/theming/defaults][here]], the theme files can be seen [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/tree/master/wm/.wm/themes][here]] (these days I usually roll with [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/.wm/themes/test][test]]), and the [[https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/.wm/scripts/theming/ltheme][ltheme]] script ties it all together. Note: over time, the ltheme script has come to represent other dynamic parts of my setup as well, beyond just themes - this includes some user level systemd services. Additionally, as my Emacs usage has increased, my coupling to a running Emacs session with [[https://github.com/neeasade/emacs.d][my emacs config]] has also ramped up.
